At my current gig, when migrating our data warehouse to Hive, I had a bit of trouble tracking down documentation on date-based windowing function support in Hive. I had to piece together information from a few sources, so I figured this might be useful to others. At the time of this post, the Hive [wiki page on windowing functions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+WindowingAndAnalytics "Windowing functions") makes no mention of range-based windows, but I did find so elsewhere. There are a couple Hive [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4197) [tickets](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4112) which mention support for range-based windows. Unfortunately, neither discuss date-based ranges which is my use case. A bit more digging turned up a valuable [interview](http://www.qubole.com/big-data-analytics-using-window-functions) with a [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com) committer where he sheds a bit more light on the topic:

The window ranges today are numeric constants, whereas, in the spec, you can have arbitrary numerical expressions. And in Hive, you donâ€™t have date intervals. So if you want to do date-based windows, you pretty much have to break down the date into components, and treat each component as a int.
{% endblockquote %}

What this tells us is we need to convert the date to a numeric constant when using it in a range window. Let's walk through an example.

Suppose we have the following transaction data:

user|store       |purchase_date|amount
:----:|:------------|:-------------:|------:
42|petes coffee|2014-01-01|1
42|petes coffee|2014-01-02|3
42|petes coffee|2014-01-03|2
42|petes coffee|2014-01-04|4
42|petes coffee|2014-01-05|1
42|petes coffee|2014-01-06|1
42|petes coffee|2014-01-07|1
44|petes coffee|2014-01-01|1
44|petes coffee|2014-01-02|1
44|petes coffee|2014-01-03|1
44|petes coffee|2014-01-04|1
44|petes coffee|2014-01-05|5
44|petes coffee|2014-01-06|5
44|petes coffee|2014-01-07|5


<p/>
Now suppose we want to answer the question: What is the 3-day purchase amount sum leading up to each transaction? The following query could answer that using a range-based window.


{% codeblock Date-based Windowing lang:sql %}
select *, 
 sum(amount) over 
   (partition by user order by unix_timestamp(purchase_date) RANGE 172800 PRECEDING) as 3_day_window
 from transactions 
 order by user, purchase_date asc;
{% endcodeblock %}

A few things to note about the query. First, we want to do this on a user-basis, so we partition by user. Next, we must use *unix_timestamp* to convert the date to a numeric constant. This will be the value in seconds since the [unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Encoding_time_as_a_number). Finally, the syntax *RANGE X PRECEDING* means: go backwards from the current row until either we hit a partition boundary or the value changes by *X* amount. The value to observe for change is controlled by the *order by* clause in the partition statement. In this case it is *unix_timestamp(purchase_date)*. For the range, I use 172800 which is 2 days in seconds. This gives me a 3 day total window since the *current row* is included.

Here is the result set:

row_num|user|store       |purchase_date|amount|3_day_total
:--|:----:|:------------|:-------------:|------:|----:
1|42|petes coffee|2014-01-01|1|1
2|42|petes coffee|2014-01-02|3|4
3|42|petes coffee|2014-01-03|2|6
4|42|petes coffee|2014-01-04|4|9
5|42|petes coffee|2014-01-05|1|7
6|42|petes coffee|2014-01-06|1|6
7|42|petes coffee|2014-01-07|1|3
8|44|petes coffee|2014-01-01|1|1
9|44|petes coffee|2014-01-02|1|2
10|44|petes coffee|2014-01-03|1|3
11|44|petes coffee|2014-01-04|1|3
12|44|petes coffee|2014-01-05|5|7
13|44|petes coffee|2014-01-06|5|11
14|44|petes coffee|2014-01-07|5|15

<p/>

Let's explain some of the results.

* **Row 9:** The 3_day_total is 2 because only row 8 is included. Row 7 is for the previous user, which is the partition boundary, so the range traversal ceases.
* **Row 10:** Here we have a full 3 day range since it does not bump up against the partition boundary. The 3_day_total is 1+1+1 for the dates 2014-01-01, 2014-01-02 and 2014-01-03.
* **Row 14:** This proves that the window is sliding along with the current row. The 3_day_total is 5+5+5 for the dates 2014-01-05, 2014-01-06 and 2014-01-07.

Hope this is useful to someone!
